<span>Chatbox</span>
</h1>

This clone of chatbox (https://chatboxai.app/) is made to inject additional context into api calls.

Added context.ts
When complete, context.ts will pull relavent context from a vector database using embeddings and keywords

The vector database is populated by another script, e.g.
https://github.com/autemox/github-to-vector
this is meant to be run when project is pushed to github
